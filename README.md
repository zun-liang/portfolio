## Overview

### Introduction

I'm super excited to introduce my portfolio v1.0 ü•≥, a project that's been a dream come true for me üí´! I've always longed for my own website, but it wasn't until I became comfortable using React router that I felt ready to build this üí™. Personally, I've always favored a traditional multipage website for a portfolio. Beyond being a significant personal milestone, this website has proven to be an excellent project for practicing my frontend skills. Not only have I sharpened my existing skills, but I've also achieved and learned a great deal throughout this exciting process ‚ú®!

This website contains five sections:

- Home Page üè†

  The landing page, equipped with a title, menu, light/dark mode switch, sound toggle, music control, links to my social accounts, real-time weather and temperature updates, and the current time.

- About me üë©‚Äçüíª

  On this page, you'll learn about my learning journey, achievements, skills, and future plans.

- Projects üõ†Ô∏è

  This page showcases the best projects I've worked on, which are updated regularly. Visitors can click on each project to dive into it backstory and details.

- Blogs üìì

  Here, you'll discover my blogs, which are mainly learning notes and thoughts. I intend to use this section as a personal repository of knowledge and skills.

- Contact üì©

  The contact page serves as a means for visitors to get in touch with me and establish a connection.

In building and designing this website, I've put a strong emphasis on **user experience** and **interactivity**. In this website, visitors are able to:

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;View the optimal layout for the website depending on their device's screen size
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;See hover/active/focus states for all interactive elements on the page
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;Toggle light and dark mode (default based on day/night)
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;Toggle sound effects (default mute)
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;Toggle background music (default mute)
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;Get weather and temperature information depending on their location
<li style="list-style-type: '‚ú®'">&nbsp;Get current time depending on their time zone
</ul>

### Purpose and Goal

- Professional connection
- Personal connection

The primary purpose behind creating this portfolio website is to establish a unique online space where I can share my ideas üí°, communicate my skills üíª, and connect with other developers üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª. Having observed numerous impressive portfolio websites out there, it's an immense source of pride and satisfaction to finally have one of my own üöÄ.

Moreover, I envision this website as a reflection of my personality and preferences üåà. It's not just a professional showcase; it's a personal space where visitors can get to know the person behind the work üë©‚Äçüíª. Through this platform, I aim to inspire and foster connections with those who share my interests and passions üíñ.

### Spotlight

- Firebase - manage data
- User authentication - "secret" blog management
- React - createContext and useContext
- Styled-components - Theming
- React router 6 - data router
- Transfer Markdown to HTML and Parse HTML in React App

At the time I started to build this website, I didn't have the knowledge or experience to work with databases and backend systems. However, I soon discovered that Firebase is a fantastic tool that I could relatively easily grasp and utilize in my project. I utilized Firestore's `getDoc` and `getDocs` to get projects and blogs.

During the process of building this website, I also embarked on my first experience with authentication. While it may not be immediately evident to regular visitors, I utilized Firestore's `auth`, `onAuthStateChanged`, `signIn`, `signOut`, `setDoc`, `deleteDoc`, `updateDoc` to integrate a simple blog management system into this project. This system allows me to exclusivly log in as admin and create, update, and edit blogs, all while securely saving them to Firebase.

Moreover, this is the very first time I used React `createContext` and `useContext` in my project. At first, I kept having bugs of context being "undefined" because I misunderstood that there was no need to import context in the components that needed it. Secondly, I didn't realize that I could wrap the `main.jsx` with the context provider. Although my `App.jsx` required access to a couple of contexts, I continued importing context in it while it was wrapped by the same context provider, which of course didn't work as I expected. It was quite frustrating but I didn't give up. I finally figured out the reasons and fixed the bugs after reading React's documentation and other people's examples.

Furthermore, I used [Styled-componnets Theming](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) with React context to manage theme colors based on light or dark mode. As I mentioned above, once I figured out how to set up context providers and use context in my project, Theming became a straightforward approach that I successfully implemented. However, there is one main differece between Theming and React context. Theming only accepts objects as value (which has to be named "theme"), while React context accepts all types of values. Apparently, React context is more flexible, but I chose to use Theming particularly in this project to avoid manually passing props to styled components, for example, `<StyledH1 ${theme}={theme}>Title</StyledH1>`. Without Theming, I would have had to pass `${theme}={theme}` as a prop to every single styled component in my entire project, resulting in a considerable amount of repetitive work in the end.

What's more, I especially utilized React Router v6 data router and its associated functions, including features such as loader, action, and deferred data processing in this project, to enhance the overall user experience and optimize the website's performance. Loaders can make sure fetched data is ready when page loads. Action makes easier to work with forms in React apps. Derferred data makes a better user experience by ...‚ùì

### What I learned

- Reading documentation

  I honestly prefer tutorial videos before I found the power of reading documentation. It is mainly because firstly, English is not my first language and learning something new in a second language can be overwhelming at the begining. Secondly, as a newbie, it is easy to feel like speeding my learning and show what I have learned to other people, even though I really don't know that much to be honest. After I realized what is holding me back from reading documentation, I slow down on purpose and read it little by little and it works for me so far.

- Git branch - merge and delete

  This project is more complicated than the old projects I workded on before. In such a project, using git smartly is very helpful. I used git branch to work on some new features, such as contexts.

### Continued development

- Time management and estimate
  I didn't intend to control time I spent on this project but during the process, I found it is crutial for developers to have a plan. Without planning ahead, it is so easy to get caught by some fancy features which may not be so crutial at that point and spend more time without proceeding.

- [ScrollRestoration v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/scroll-restoration)

  I was having difficulty creating a "back to top" button and I found a couple things to consider. First, I learned that my scrollable container is not window but body in this case according to Firefox dev tools. Second, my scroll to top button doesn't help to load new page's begining but the position of old page where I was at, then I found scrollRestoration from react router which is very helpful but also "remembers" window.location. ScrollRestoration only works on window level. not working here...

- [index.tsx:24 Uncaught Error: useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71979809/index-tsx24-uncaught-error-uselocation-may-be-used-only-in-the-context-of-a)

  I had the same error and was thinking where to put my scroll component for the best. This answer inspired me to add it in layout route and enable to utilize useLocation.

#### Styled-Components

- [Theming](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)

#### APIs

- [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)

  To get local weather and temperature depending on visitor's' location

#### Markdown

- [react-md-editor](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-md-editor/)

  I first tried rich text editor (TinyMCE) but later switched to Markdown editor because firstly rich text editor's data can not be stored formatted in Firebase as I expected. Secondly, I am more familiar with Markdown so far. But I will be more than willing to learn more about rich text editor and utilize it in my future projects.
